                <p>
                    I am a growing Full-Stack Developer who is currently enrolled in the B.S.I.T. program at the Daytona
                    State College. While
                    completing relevant coursework such as Software Engineering, Data Structures, Computer Programming,
                    UI/IX design, and more, I have developed a passion for creating intuitive web applications that
                    provide dynamic experiences for
                    the end user.<br> While completing my bachelor's degree I have had the opportunity
                    to work on projects independantly and in collaboration with fellow student developers. These projects
                     allowed me to engage my passion to help others and solve problems. As a Full-Stack developer, I 
                    enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven
                     work ethic to change the world.<br><br>
                    Current Focus: MERN Stack Development
